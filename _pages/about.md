Since December 2018, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Ryerson Multimedia Research Laboratory](https://www.ryerson.ca/multimedia-research-laboratory/){:target="\_blank"} in Toronto. My research focuses on 6D pose estimation of objects from monocular rgb camera using deep learning.

I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in 2010 (110/110), and my PhD in Biorobotics from the [BioRobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics/biorobotics-institute){:target="\_blank"} of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2014 (cum laude). I was Postdoctoral Fellow at the BioRobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna from 2014 to 2015, where I was involved in the subproject [“SP10 – Neurorobotics platform”](https://neurorobotics.net/){:target="\_blank"} of the Human Brain Project (HBP). From January 2016 to November 2018 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Computer Vision Laboratory (VisLab)](http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/){:target="\_blank"}, [Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/){:target="\_blank"}, Lisbon. My main research interests were on visual sensory-motor predictive controllers and on learning by demonstration for humanoid robots using vision and deep neural networks.

I collaborated in a number of EU Projects ([RoboSom](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93814_en.html){:target="\_blank"}, [Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/){:target="\_blank"}) and my research interests are in the areas of deep neural networks, machine learning, computer vision, internal models, predictive controllers and bioinspired robotics.
