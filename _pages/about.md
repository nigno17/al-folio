<p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at ISR. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in 2010 (110/110), and my PhD in Biorobotics from the BioRobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2014 (cum laude). I was Postdoctoral Fellow at the BioRobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna from 2014 to 2015, where I was involved in the subproject “SP10 – Neurorobotics platform” of the Human Brain Project (HBP). Since January 2016 I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Computer Vision Laboratory (VisLab), Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR), Lisbon. I collaborated in a number of EU Projects (RoboSom, Human Brain Project) and my research interest are in the areas of bioinspired robotics, deep neural networks and machine learning, computer vision, internal models and predictive controllers.</p>
