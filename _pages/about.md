I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at ISR. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in 2010 (110/110), and my PhD in Biorobotics from the [BioRobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics/biorobotics-institute){:target="\_blank"} of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2014 (cum laude). I was Postdoctoral Fellow at the BioRobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna from 2014 to 2015, where I was involved in the subproject [“SP10 – Neurorobotics platform”](https://neurorobotics.net/){:target="\_blank"} of the Human Brain Project (HBP). Since January 2016 I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Computer Vision Laboratory (VisLab)](http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/){:target="\_blank"}, Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR), Lisbon. I collaborated in a number of EU Projects ([RoboSom](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93814_en.html){:target="\_blank"}, [Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/){:target="\_blank"}) and my research interest are in the areas of bioinspired robotics, deep neural networks and machine learning, computer vision, internal models and predictive controllers.
